## analysis of Tube Amplifier Distortion (PC simulation)  

### Input signal is 1KHz -10dB sin wave  

FFT spectrum of 1KHz-10dB_44100Hz_400ms-TwoTube_stereo.wav. There are 2nd harmonic(2KHz) and 3rd harmonic(3KHz).  
![figure_input1](doc/spectrum_FFT4096Hanning_TwoTube_1KHz_wav.png)  
  
BPF_analysis1.py output. Dark white line in the mid area shows 2nd harmonic(2KHz). Bright white line shows 1KHz.  
Start wave pattern is filter transient response.  
![figure_input2](doc/BPF_analysis1_outputFigure_TwoTube_1KHz_wav.png)  

### Input signal is mix of 400Hz -10dB sin wave and 1KHz -10dB sin wave  

FFT spectrum of Mix_400Hz1KHz-10dB_44100Hz_400msec_TwoTube_mono.wav.  There are 600Hz, 1400Hz, etc other than 800Hz, 2KHz, 1600Hz and 3000Hz.   
![figure_input3](doc/spectrum_FFT4096Hanning_TwoTube_400Hz1KHz_MIX_wav.png)  

BPF_analysis1.py output. Dark white lines show 600Hz, 1400Hz, and 2KHz.

## Compare matching portion of two spectrograms  

A music spectrogram comparison of input and output of Tube Amplifier (PC simulation).  

Matching portion (red rectangle area) in the template spectrogram  to compare.  
Set diagonal position by pointing-device mouse and exist figure. Matching portion in the matching spectrogram will be detected by cv2.matchTemplate function.  
![figure_input5](doc/template.png)  

each matching portion of template spectrogram and matching spectrogram  
![figure_input6](doc/compare.png)  

matching portion and its difference (red means positive  and blue means negative)    
![figure_input7](doc/diff.png)  


## Search some similar area near the specified area in spectrogram  

Specify the area as diagonal position by pointing-device mouse. And then, click right mouse button or press m on keyboard.  
![figure_input8](doc/similar_areas.png)  


## Spectrogram, 2D FFT, and 2D inverse FFT

In the following figure, from top to bottom, spectrogram, 2D inverse FFT of red rectangle in 2D FFT, and 2D FFT of the spectrogram.  

![figure_input9](doc/2D-FFT-2D-IFFT.png)  


## Search some similar area to the specified area in another channel spectrogram  


Load stero(2 channel) wav file and make Spectrogram per each channel (show Figure 1 and Figure 2).  
Search some similar area to the specified area in another channel.  
Specify the area as diagonal position by pointing-device mouse. And then, click right mouse button or press m on keyboard.  
![figure_input10](doc/stereo_matching.png)  

After above completed, then press c on keyboard. It will compute difference between both channel, after time correction.  
![figure_input11](doc/channel_difference.png)  
Peak or bottom in the difference, frequency characteristic between channels, is significant, because real signal is available at the point to be compared.
